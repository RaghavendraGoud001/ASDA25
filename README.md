Hi, I’m Raghavendra!. I completed my Bachelor’s in Computer Science in India, where I focused on Data Science and Big Data Analytics.

I’ve worked on projects in data analysis, embedded systems, and bio products, and I enjoy using data to solve real-world problems. I’m curious and excited for further things.
