Hi, I’m Raghavendra! I’m studying M.Sc. in Management and Data Science at Leuphana University Lüneburg, Germany. I completed my Bachelor’s in Computer Science in India, where I focused on Data Science and Big Data Analytics.

I’ve worked on projects in data analysis, embedded systems, and bio products, and I enjoy using data to solve real-world problems. I’m curious, motivated, and always excited to learn new things and grow in the fields of data and business analysis.
