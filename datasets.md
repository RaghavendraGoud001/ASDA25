1. Stock–Sentiment Combined Dataset

Description:
This dataset combines historical stock market data of a selected company from the NIFTY 50 index with corresponding financial news sentiment. The price data includes daily open, high, low, close, and volume values, while the news dataset provides published headlines and sentiment labels (positive, neutral, negative). By merging these sources by date, the dataset links quantitative market behavior with qualitative investor sentiment.

Why I Chose It:
I wanted to understand how external news and investor sentiment influence short-term stock price movements and volatility in the Indian market. This dataset allows me to analyze whether positive or negative headlines correspond with price fluctuations and risk levels. It reflects how market psychology and media coverage can affect trading activity for large-cap Indian companies.
